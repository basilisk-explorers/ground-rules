# Code of Conduct
### Basilisk Explorers Code of Conduct


Basilisk Explorers is a place where Explorers should feel welcome and included. And while things can get a little rough from time to time, we also want to ensure people always feel safe 👍

The purpose of this document is to outline the Explorer Group values - what we do, and don’t, stand for - and the measures we take to protect them.


# Inclusivity 🙌
We want everyone to feel included during their time at Explorers. In particular, nobody should ever feel excluded on the basis of their:

* Gender, gender identity, or gender expression
* Sexual orientation
* Disability or medical condition
* Physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
* Race
* Age
* Religion


# Our Shared Values ☀️

#### You agree that:

  * We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
  * We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
  * We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
  * We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
  * We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.
  * We do not suggest or speculate on ways of breaking the law.

#### We actively work towards:

  * Being a safe and welcoming Explorer unit.
  * Being a network of support and encouragement for each other.
  * Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression.

#### We condemn:

  * Any form of harm or harassment.
  * Any physical contact outside of contact games.
  * Anything that compromises people’s safety.


# Consequences for breaking the rules 🚨

We take a strong stance on enforcing our code of conduct. In severe cases, we'll consider what happened on an individual basis.

For other issues, we’ll follow these steps -

 - First offence: we’ll issue a formal warning, verbally. It will also be documented to ensure there's a record of when it happened. Whenever a warning is issued, we will refer back to this document and indicate the part of the Code of Conduct we feel has been breached.

 - Second offence: A further warning will be issued, in stronger terms. This will include notifying the parents, and will talk about what happens if our Code of Conduct continues to not be followed - which can include suspension or removal from Basilisk Explorers.

 - Third offence: We will take action. This can be a short-term suspension (for repeated misbehaviour), a long-term suspension (for repeated misbehaviour on a large scale, or a significant incident), or removal from Basilisk Explorers permanently (for extremely serious situations).

For future offences, if - following a suspension - the Explorer returns and continues to be disruptive and act contrary to the above agreements, a full removal will be happen without warning.

tldr; Explorers receive two warnings (the second stronger), then an appropriate action, and following offences will result in removal from the group.
