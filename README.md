# Basilisk Explorers Policies

## Overview
Basilisk Explorers is a place where Explorers should feel welcome and included. And while things can get a little rough from time to time, we also want to ensure people always feel safe üëç

The purpose of this document is to outline the Basilisk Explorers values - what we do, and don‚Äôt stand for, and the measures we take to protect them. It also covers our safeguarding policies as well as anyt other important information.

## Safeguarding
To help keep everyone safe and protected, the [Scouts safeguarding policy](https://www.scouts.org.uk/about-us/policy/safeguarding-policy-and-procedures/) sets out the rules we need to follow.

One of the key requirements is that adults and Explorers should not be alone on a 1-to-1 basis. This is all about creating visibility, so at least 3 people know about any communication. Most of the time, this is achieved in-person by ensuring there will always be multiple leaders or Explorers present. Online, the rule is the same - this mostly comes up in calls and messaging.

Explorers and leaders can talk together in our shared group chat. This group chat is used for event updates, as well as key information the Explorers might need. To maintain safeguarding, Explorers: please don't send individual messages to leaders. If it's necessary to message outside the shared group chat, you should make another group chat that includes at least two current leaders. If you do message a leader directly, they are required to share that information with other leaders, and they won't respond unless it's an emergency or a sensitive issue.

If a call happens between a leader and an Explorer, at least one of you should be with another leader/Explorer, ideally placing the call on speaker. Let the other person know who you're with. In the event of an emergency or sensitive issue where it's not feasible to create visibility, the leader will share the information with other leaders.

## Uniform üëî
### Indoor Meetings
All Leaders and Explorers are expected to wear their full uniform. Uniform consists of the Basilisk Explorers necker/scarf, as well an Explorer shirt. Group clothing can be worn as a replacement for an Explorer shirt. Uniform should be worn during the opening and closing ceremony, but can be removed during the main portion of the evening.

### Outdoor Meetings
All Leaders and Explorers are not expected to wear their full uniform, but will need to wear their necker/scarf. Group clothing should be worn if this is owned. Neckers/scarfs should be worn during the entire evening, and shouldn't be removed. When outside, we're representing Scouting.

## Code of Conduct
### Inclusivity üôå
We want everyone to feel included during their time at Explorers. In particular, nobody should ever feel excluded on the basis of their:

* Gender, gender identity, or gender expression
* Sexual orientation
* Disability or medical condition
* Physical appearance
* Race
* Age
* Religion


### Our Shared Values ‚òÄÔ∏è

#### You agree that:

* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity. 
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination. 
* We respect people‚Äôs boundaries and identities. 
* We don't use language that could be considered: sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs. 
* We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humour. 


#### We actively work towards:

  * Being a safe and welcoming Explorer unit.
  * Being a network of support and encouragement for each other.
  * Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression.

#### We condemn:

  * Any form of harm or harassment.
  * Any physical contact outside of contact games.
  * Anything that compromises people‚Äôs safety.


### Consequences for breaking the rules üö®

We take a strong stance on enforcing our code of conduct. In severe cases, we'll consider what happened on an individual basis.

For other issues, we‚Äôll follow these steps -

 - First offence: we‚Äôll issue a formal warning, verbally. It will also be documented to ensure there's a record of when it happened. Whenever a warning is issued, we will refer back to this document and indicate the part of the Code of Conduct we feel has been breached.

 - Second offence: A further warning will be issued, in stronger terms. This will include notifying the parents, and will talk about what happens if our Code of Conduct continues to not be followed - which can include suspension or removal from Basilisk Explorers.

 - Third offence: We will take action. This can be a short-term suspension (for repeated misbehaviour), a long-term suspension (for repeated misbehaviour on a large scale, or a significant incident), or removal from Basilisk Explorers permanently (for extremely serious situations).

For future offences, if - following a suspension - the Explorer returns and continues to be disruptive and act contrary to the above agreements, a full removal will be happen without warning.

tldr; Explorers receive two warnings (the second stronger), then an appropriate action, and following offences will result in removal from the group.


### Alerting us üôãüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you see something, hear something or are involved in something that makes you feel uncomfortable, please flag it to one of the leaders. Here‚Äôs how -

- You can get a parent/guardian to contact us if you don't want to contact us directly
